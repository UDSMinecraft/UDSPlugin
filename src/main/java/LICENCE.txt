2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce, limit, or

3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor
   hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for
   the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in
   the Work as stated below:

    a. to Reproduce and Distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works
       thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or
       Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:
    b. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation,
       including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to
       clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to
       the original Work.

   The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known
   or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such
   modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other
   media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted
   by Licensor are hereby reserved, including but not limited to the rights
   described in Section 4(g).

4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made
   subject to and limited by the following restrictions:

    a. You may Distribute the Work only under the terms of this License. You
       must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for,
       this License with every copy of the Work You Distribute. You may not
       offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this
       License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the
       rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may
       not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to
       this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the
       Work You Distribute. When You Distribute the Work, You may not impose any
       effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of
       a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that
       recipient under the terms of the License. If You create an Adaptation,
       upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove
       from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(e), as requested.
    b. You may Distribute an Adaptation only under: (i) the terms of this
       License; (ii) a later version of this License with the same License
       Elements as this License; (iii) a Creative Commons or Open Source
       Initiative-approved jurisdiction license (either this or a later license
       version) that contains the same License Elements as this License (e.g.,
       Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 US) ("Applicable License"). You
       must include a copy of, or the URI, for Applicable License with every
       copy of each Adaptation You Distribute. You may not offer or impose any
       terms on the Adaptation that restrict the terms of the Applicable License
       or the ability of the recipient of the Adaptation to exercise the rights
       granted to that recipient under the terms of the Applicable License. You
       must keep intact all notices that refer to the Applicable License and to
       the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work as included in
       the Adaptation You Distribute. When You Distribute the Adaptation, You
       may not impose any effective technological measures on the Adaptation
       that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Adaptation from You to
       exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the
       Applicable License.
    c. An executable Object form of the Work may be deployed in a website, for
       the purpose of communicating information to other human beings, in any
       manner providing the cumulative number of page Deliveries that include
       the Work per typical month does not exceed (and could not be reasonably
       expected to exceed) 10,000 Deliveries. A "Delivery" is a transmission of
       the Object form of the Work from any server comprising the website to a
       remote recipient. There may be many Deliveries to the same person or
       computer or electronic device and each transmission is a separate, unique
       Delivery.
    d. Apart from the exception outlined in 4(c), You may not exercise any of
       the rights granted to You in Section 3 above in any manner that is
       primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private
       monetary compensation.
    e. If You Distribute the Work or any Adaptations, You must, unless a request
       has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices
       for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are
       utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if
       applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor
       designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing
       entity, journal) for attribution ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's
       copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name
       of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii)
       to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor
       specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer
       to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and, (iv)
       consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit
       identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., "Based on code
       adapted from original Work by Original Author"). The credit required by
       this Section 4(d) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided,
       however, that in the case of a Adaptation, at a minimum such credit will
       appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation
       appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as
       prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the
       avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section
       for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by
       exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or
       explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or
       endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties,
       as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate,
       express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or
       Attribution Parties.
    f. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names,
       trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as
       required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the
       Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
    g. For the avoidance of doubt:

        i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in
           which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or
           compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves
           the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You
           of the rights granted under this License;
        ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which
           the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory
           licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive
           right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights
           granted under this License if Your exercise of such rights is for a
           purpose or use which is otherwise than noncommercial as permitted
           under Section 4(c) and otherwise waives the right to collect
           royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme; and,
        iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor reserves the right to
           collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the
           Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers
           voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by
           You of the rights granted under this License that is for a purpose or
           use which is otherwise than noncommercial as permitted under Section
           4(c).

    h. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any
       Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to
       the Licensor that is accepted to become part of the work shall be
       distributed subject to the conditions of this License, without any
       additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein
       shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you
       may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

   UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING AND TO THE
   FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS
   AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK,
   EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
   WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,
   NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE
   PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME
   JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO THIS
   EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN
   NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL,
   INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS
   LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
   POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. Termination

    a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
       automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.
       Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations from You under this
       License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such
       individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses.
       Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this
       License.
    b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is
       perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).
       Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the
       Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at
       any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to
       withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required
       to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will
       continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.

8. Miscellaneous

    a. Each time You Distribute the Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a
       license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license
       granted to You under this License.
    b. Each time You Distribute an Adaptation, Licensor offers to the recipient
       a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the
       license granted to You under this License.
    c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under
       applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the
       remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the
       parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the
       minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
    d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach
       consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed
       by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.
    e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with
       respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings,
       agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified
       here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may
       appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified
       without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.
    f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this
       License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention
       for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on
       September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright
       Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and
       the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These
       rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in
       which the License terms are sought to be enforced according to the
       corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions
       in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of rights granted
       under applicable copyright law includes additional rights not granted
       under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in
       the License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any
       rights under applicable law.
