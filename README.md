If you are interested in contributing code to the project you may send pull requests but we ask that you follow our coding guidelines.

## Coding Guidelines

For the most part we follow the Code Conventions for the Java Programming Language which you can find here: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/codeconv-138413.html.
Any coding practices that do not directly follow these conventions will be apparent from viewing the UDSPlugin source code.
Pull requests should always address an issue, if an issue does not yet exist then we request that you create one. We also ask that your commits make reference to the issues either with Fixes #XXX for bugs or Closes #XXX for all other issues.
