# UDSPlugin1
The midway evolution of the UDSPlugin, to fill a void should WorkBench take a while to complete.

## Suggestions
If you have any ideas or suggestions please just post an issue on GitHub and I'll get on it.

## Contributions
These can come in two forms, you could suggest code improvements or new ways of implementing methods, both are welcome. Please just post comments wherever they make sense on GitHub.

## A Personal Note
In my defence I first started using Java seriously when I began work on UDSPlugin and I think I have made huge improvements since then.

I did take a course on OOP at University so I am not a complete stranger but please understand I am and always will be still learning.
